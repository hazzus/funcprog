HIFM - HIFM is more than a file manager.

It's an atomic file manager with a simple integrated vcs.

## Note
VCS in this variant of homework is snapshot-based, only works with directories as an entities, but still can cat file of specified revision. However there is no merge, no remove, no add.   
That was just to hard to handle with it in deadline (but I decided to do at least something)

# Usage
It's intuitive, just run it with `stack run -- --help`, to see run options. Inside the hifm type help to see avaliable commands.
